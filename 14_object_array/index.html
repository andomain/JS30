    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let a = 100;
    let b = a;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Sam'
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const playersCopy = players.slice();
    playersCopy[2] = 'test';

    console.log(players, playersCopy);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const playersNew = [].concat(players);
    playersNew[2] = 'test';
    console.log(players, playersNew);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const playersSpread = [...players];
    playersSpread[2] = 'test';
    console.log(players, playersSpread);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Sam',
        age: 27
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const newPerson = person;
    // newPerson.name = 'new'

    // console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const personCopy = Object.assign({},person,{name:'copied Person'});
    console.log(person, personCopy);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
