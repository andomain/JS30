Day 7 saw the return of the array cardio!!! I was kind of looking forward to this as the previous one made me realise the power of Array methods & I was keen to learn some more. There were much fewer questions on this day so I quickly worked through them, learning about the .some(), .all(), .find() & .findINdex() methods in the process. This was a pretty easy one so I'll quickly summarise the methods I learned below:

.some() : The .some() method loops passes each element of an array to a callback function. If any of the elements cause this function to return true then the .some() method also returns true.

.all() : The .all() method behaves very similarly to the .some() method, however it only returns true if ALL the array elements satisfy the callback function.

.find() : The .find() function loops through an array and returns the elements that cause the supplied callback to return true. If a single element is found then it is returned, whereas an array is used if multiple elements satisfy the conditions.

.findIndex() : This method behaves very similarly to .find() but only returns the index(es) of the elements that satisfy the callback. This can be useful for determining elements to delete etc.

While there were fewer methods covered in todays challenge, I can definitely see their usefulness. Using ES6 arrow functions, it is easy to create powerful one-line solutions to problems that would require several lines of a for loop.
